Q6. Every other sub-list
Given a list and 2 indices as input, return the sub-list enclosed within these 2 indices. It should
contain every second element.
E.g.
Input f([2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41], 2, 9)
Return [5, 11, 17, 23]

Solution :-

original_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41]
sliced_list = original_list[2:9]
new_list = sliced_list[::2]
print(new_list)
