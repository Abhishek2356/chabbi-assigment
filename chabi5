Q5. Common, Not Common
Given 2 lists in input. Write a program to return the elements, which are common to both
lists(set intersection) and those which are not common(set symmetric difference) between the
lists.
Input:
Mainstream = ["One Punch Man","Attack On Titan","One Piece","Sword
Art Online","Bleach","Dragon Ball Z","One Piece"]
must_watch = ["Full Metal Alchemist","Code Geass","Death
Note","Stein's Gate","The Devil is a Part Timer!","One Piece","Attack
On Titan"]
f(mainstream, must_watch) should return:
["One Piece", "Attack On Titan"], ["Dragon Ball Z", "Death Note",
"One Punch Man", "Stein's Gate", "The Devil is a Part Timer!", "Sword
Art Online","Full Metal Alchemist","'Bleach", "Code Geass"]

Solution :-

mainstream = ["One Punch Man","Attack On Titan","OnePiece","SwordArt Online",
              "Bleach","Dragon Ball Z","One Piece"]
must_watch = ["Full Metal Alchemist","Code Geass","DeathNote",
              "Stein's Gate","The Devil is a Part Timer!","One Piece","Attack On Titan"]
common_list = list(set(mainstream) & set(must_watch))
uncommon_list = list(set(mainstream) ^ set(must_watch))
print(f"List of The Common Elements: {common_list}")
print()
print(f"List of The UnCommon Elements: {uncommon_list}")
